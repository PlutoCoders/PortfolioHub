### Steps to Creating the Project
- make sure you have node installed (check with node -v)
- npm init -y (the following command does this automatically though, so its not neccesary)
- npx create-react-app portfoliohub (if there are errors, reload/trash your terminal)
- - this will create your react structure (public, src, package.json, etc)
- Check package.json for a default start script (then use it)
- make sure to cd into your new react folder in order to run commands
- npm start (to start the application)
- ctrl click the local host link such as: "http://localhost:3000"
- your default app will be running in the browser
- When its time to deplot, look up netlify. 
- Make an account and sign up/in with github for a streamlined process. Then deploy from the project repo.

## Credits
- I'd like to thank our tutor Rakib (strawhat) for being the best tutor ever! Thanks so much for helping us navigate and survive this course!
- I did this with my brother, who is also always helping with everything he can. Thank bro!
- Special thanks to material from the course
- Special thanks to ai assistance and stackOverflow when at hurdles!

### ToDo
- Mobile Responsiveness
- Better Styling of home page graphics
- Scroll Transition and better background
- Animated Gifs/graphics of stars, planets, etc to make the site feel more alive
- Improved about me/resume section with polished and memorable styling
- Add featured portfolio projects to the home page.
- Different pages can have different spinning logos and background/planets specific to the page
- Contact Form Improvements
- Improved Footer styling
- Footer "back to top" button
- Navbar page button signals what page the user is on
- Last updated date-time display in home page?
- Calming spacey music?
- Portfolio sections: Recent Github, Featured Projects, music, roblox games, etc (more organized,expansive, and easy to navigate structure for different portfolios)



<!-- Random Creating React App info -->
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
